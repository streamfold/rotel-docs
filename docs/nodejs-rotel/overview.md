# Overview


The [rotel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@streamfold/rotel) Node.js package provides a bundled distribution of [Rotel](/docs/about/rotel) for Javascript and Typescript applications. When started, it spawns a background daemon that accepts OpenTelemetry metrics, traces, and logs. Designed for minimal overhead, Rotel reduces resource consumption while simplifying telemetry collection and processing in Node.js applicationsâ€”without requiring additional sidecar containers.
