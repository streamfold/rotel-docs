# Overview


This package provides an embedded OpenTelemetry collector, built on the lightweight Rotel collector. When started, it spawns a background daemon that accepts OpenTelemetry metrics, traces, and logs. Designed for minimal overhead, Rotel reduces resource consumption while simplifying telemetry collection and processing in Node.js applicationsâ€”without requiring additional sidecar containers.
