# Overview

The [rotel](https://pypi.org/project/rotel/) Python package, referred to here as _pyrotel_, provides a bundled distribution of [Rotel](/docs/about/rotel) for Python applications. When started, it spawns a background daemon that accepts OpenTelemetry metrics, traces, and logs. Designed for minimal overhead, Rotel reduces resource consumption while simplifying telemetry collection and processing in complex Python applicationsâ€”without requiring additional sidecar containers.
