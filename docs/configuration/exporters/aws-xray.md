# AWS X-Ray Exporter

Export OpenTelemetry traces to AWS X-Ray.

| Telemetry Type | Support |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Traces         | Alpha   |

The AWS X-Ray exporter can be selected by passing `--exporter awsxray`. The X-Ray exporter only supports traces. Note:
X-Ray
limits batch sizes to 50 traces segments. If you assign a `--batch-max-size` of greater than 50, Rotel will override and
enforce the max
batch size of 50 with the warning
`INFO AWS X-Ray only supports a batch size of 50 segments, setting batch max size to 50`

See the [AWS Auth](/docs/configuration/aws-auth) page for instructions on how to retrieve credentials necessary
for exporting to X-Ray.
